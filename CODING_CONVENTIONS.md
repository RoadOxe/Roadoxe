## Naming Conventions

- **File Names**: Use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens (-). Example: `user-service.ts`, `database-connector.ts`.

- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive and meaningful names. Use camel case for variables and start with a lowercase letter. Example: `userName`, `itemCount`.

- **Function Names**: Use descriptive and meaningful names. Use camel case and start with a lowercase letter. Example: `calculateTotalPrice()`, `getUserData()`.

- **Class Names**: Use Pascal case and start with an uppercase letter. Example: `UserService`, `DatabaseConnector`.

- **Constants**: Use uppercase letters and separate words with underscores (\_). Example: `MAX_ITEMS`, `API_KEY`.

## Indentation and Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.

- Use meaningful whitespace and proper line breaks to improve code readability.

- Use consistent and clear formatting for code blocks, curly braces, and parentheses.

## Comments

- Include comments to explain complex logic, algorithms, or any code that might not be self-explanatory.

- Provide context and explain the purpose of functions, classes, and modules using comments.

- Avoid excessive or redundant comments. Focus on clarity and providing additional information when necessary.

## Error Handling

- Properly handle errors and exceptions in your code.

- Use try-catch blocks for capturing and handling exceptions.

- Provide meaningful error messages and log them appropriately.

## Code Organization

- Use meaningful and logical folder and file structures to organize your code.

- Separate concerns and functionalities into modules and classes.

- Avoid having large, monolithic functions or classes. Instead, break them down into smaller, reusable components.

## Code Documentation

- Include inline comments to document important sections of code, especially complex algorithms or non-obvious logic.

- Document public APIs, functions, and classes using JSDoc or TypeScript-style comments.

- Clearly specify the purpose, parameters, return types, and any exceptions for public-facing code.

## Testing

- Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

- Write comprehensive unit tests for each module and function.

- Use a testing framework like Jest for writing and running tests.

- Regularly run tests and maintain a high level of test coverage.

These coding conventions will help maintain a consistent codebase, improve readability, and make collaboration easier. By following these conventions, we aim to achieve a clean, maintainable, and reliable codebase.

Please feel free to customize and expand upon these conventions to fit the specific needs of your project.
